FA Digger built in compliance with FA's TOS and COC

NOTES:
  - Artist list supports:
    - Multi-select
    - Ctrl + A, Ctrl + C, Ctrl + V for Select All, Copy Names and Paste Names
    - Download from selected artists via right-click context menu
    - some other shit i guess

KNOWN ISSUES (that I cba to fix):
  - "Import all artists from your artist list" will cause a crash. (Due to a change in the login process)
  - "Get Artist Statuses" will cause the program to become unresponsive.
  - Journal downloading unsupported.
  - FA Beta unsupported (Likely unable to work around).
